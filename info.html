            <ul>
              <li>Avoid exercising outdoors when pollution levels are high. When the air is bad, walk indoors in a shopping mall or gym or use an exercise machine. Limit the amount of time your child spends playing outdoors if the air quality is unhealthy.</li>
              <li>Don't allow anyone to smoke indoors and support measures to make all public places tobacco-free.</li>
              <li>Don't burn wood or trash. Burning firewood and trash are among the major sources of particle pollution (soot) in many parts of the country.</li>
            </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Check daily air pollution index in your area. The color-coded forecasts can let you know when the air is unhealthy in your community.</li>
                <li>N95/99 masks should be used whenever you step out in a air polluted area after checking the air quality index.</li>
                <li>Air Purifying plants such as Aloe Vera, Ivy and Spider Plant can be placed in the home and offices. They help purify indoor air and minimise indoor pollution.</li>
                <li>Use air purifiers, especially in kids room and the room of elderly (and even pregnant women). They are most prone to the ill effects of this toxic air.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>When you start your car in the morning, roll down your window to let the air circulate. Next, run car AC in indoor circulation mode, which will reduce the PM 2.5 level considerably.</li>
                <li>Eat jaggery (aka gudd) to flush out pollutants from your lungs. You can simply have it raw or replace it with sugar in your daily preparations.</li>
                <li>Open your windows and doors between 3 pm - 5 pm and allow the air to circulate. On a bright sunny day, this is the time slot when concentration of PM 2.5 is the lowest in the air.</li>
